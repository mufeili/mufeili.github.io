I'm a third-year PhD student in machine learning at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue/home). My current research interest is **memory mechanisms of foundation models**, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation, long-context reasoning, long-term memory, etc.

Prior to that, I was a software development engineer (SDE) at Amazon Web Services (AWS) Shanghai AI Lab. I received my bachelor's degree in Honors Math from [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/).
