I'm a second-year PhD student in machine learning at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue/home). My current research interests include **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** and **graph generative models**.

Prior to that, I was a software development engineer (SDE) at Amazon Web Services (AWS) Shanghai AI Lab. I received my bachelor's degree in Honors Math from [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/).
